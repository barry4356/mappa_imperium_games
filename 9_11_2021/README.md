**Colonization.** The Nephalim take to the seas in their giant canoes! Paddling for what couldn’t have been more than 5 minutes, they hastily arrive on the shores of Lake Loch Island; a new land awaits! Eager settlers flock to the new village and before long the bustling coastal town of Kanoodear was born. But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? Tis the lizardfolk across the water, surely this expansion will be consequence free...

**Ancient Ruins.** Scouts return to the Dread Keep, with news of the surrounding world. It has been known that Narnova (goddess of the hearth) is a dominant force upon these lands, but signs indicate a second god, Goran.

What was once thought to be no more than old wives tales begins to prove true with the news of a decimated hunting party. Returning with less than half their original members, the survivors are visibly shaken. They bring word of a deeper wood in the heart of the forest. A strange grove of impossibly old trees with runes carved in the bark. But how could there be footprints leading out of the mystic grove when there were no prints leading in...has Anki cast out another?

**New Geography.** Garag-nar stares out across the Barrows from the battlements of The Dread Keep, and ponders the scout report he just received. A party of lesser-daemons returned from the frosted isle, with a more detailed mapping of the isle’s geography, including a new river. However, it’s the very end of their report that has Garag-nar now pondering; the mast of a ship spotted to the East. Within Garag-nar, his patience and his blood-lust feud. From the seemingly endless crypts beneath the Barrows, they’ve found an abundance of both man-flesh and ancient weapons (thank the foolish mortals for burying their dead with their valuables). The armories of The Dread Keep grow more full by the day. Garag-nar stares East, and Garag-nar ponders...
