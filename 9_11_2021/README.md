# The Beginning

![firstage](FirstAge.png)

## The Pantheon
### <img src="AnkaiSymbol.png" width="35" height="35"> Ankai, god of the skies
Long ago, war broke out in the heavens. Slaying as many of the gods as he could find, Ankai rose victorious. For their refusal to help aid Ankai in his quest for dominion, the Nephilim were cast from the skies and bound to the mortal realms.

### <img src="GoranSymbol.png" width="35" height="35"> Goran, god of the Mountain
Goran is an elder god, who has always taken an interest in the affairs of mortals. When Ankai rose up and made war upon the gods, Goran fled to the mortal realm, and established his dominion upon the Frosted Twin mountains. Long ages passed, with Goran reigning from his mountain refuge until the arrival of Narnova. Goran and Narnova made war upon each other, decimating an entire island and turning one nation into the Barrows and one into the Wastes. Both were much weakened after the battle, Narnova fled into hiding, and Goran fell back to his mountain. It was shorly after that Skaven assaulted Goran's isle, the god attempted to wipe them out, decimating an entire city (and accidentally creating a religion to the East). The Skaven infested the caverns beneath the mountain, and the god began a war of attrition with the crafty demons.

### <img src="NarnovaSymbol.png" width="35" height="35"> Narnova, goddess of the Hearth
Narnova is a younger goddess, born of two survivors of Ankai's ascent. Narnova's only contribution to the world has been a terrible god-war against Goran (decimating a large portion of the land, and throwing much into chaos).

# Age of Discovery

![secondage](SecondAge.png)

**Colonization.** The Nephalim take to the seas in their giant canoes! Paddling for what couldn’t have been more than 5 minutes, they hastily arrive on the shores of Lake Loch Island; a new land awaits! Eager settlers flock to the new village and before long the bustling coastal town of Kanoodear was born. But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? Tis the lizardfolk across the water, surely this expansion will be consequence free...

> **Ancient Ruins.** Scouts return to the Dread Keep, with news of the surrounding world. It has been known that Narnova (goddess of the hearth) is a dominant force upon these lands, but signs indicate a second god, Goran. 
Nearby, to the East, lies the frosted isle. Scouts report spotting the ruins of a once great city upon the island. No worldly power could have wrought such destruction, and few know the wrath of an angry god better than the Barrow Ravagers. Perhaps another temple is required...

**Fantastic landmark!** Long have there been tales of strange disappearances in the deep wood. What was once thought to be no more than old wives tales begins to prove true with the news of a decimated hunting party. Returning with less than half their original members, the survivors are visibly shaken. They bring word of a deeper wood in the heart of the forest. A strange grove of impossibly old trees with runes carved in the bark. But how could there be footprints leading out of the mystic grove when there were no prints leading in...has Anki cast out another?

> **New Geography.** Garag-nar stares out across the Barrows from the battlements of The Dread Keep, and ponders the scout report he just received. A party of lesser-daemons returned from the frosted isle, with a more detailed mapping of the isle’s geography, including a new river. However, it’s the very end of their report that has Garag-nar now pondering; the mast of a ship spotted to the East. Within Garag-nar, his patience and his blood-lust feud. From the seemingly endless crypts beneath the Barrows, they’ve found an abundance of both man-flesh and ancient weapons (thank the foolish mortals for burying their dead with their valuables). The armories of The Dread Keep grow more full by the day. Garag-nar stares East, and Garag-nar ponders...

**Colonization.** Taking to the high seas once more, the intrepid Nephilim explorers find yet another new land. Full of mostly giant bugs and giant swamps, the Island of Fools Quagmire proved to be a giant pain for the giant fools. With no desire to stay, the explorers promptly packed their backs to paddle home when they realized they had gotten themselves thoroughly lost in the swamp. While they did eventually find a reliable route back to the high seas, they had already given up hope and founded the new bustling, and buzzing with mosquitos, town of Bogsmead.

> **New tribe.** A small fishing boat washed up on the shores of the wastes. After briefly interrogating (and subsequently devouring) the boat’s tiny, squealing occupant, it was discovered that he did not speak any known language. It was assumed that he originated from the isle of sunken marshland. Scouts should be sent to investigate further

**Expansion.** In the wake of a recent uptick in disappeared villagers, the lords in the council of Uruk declare that a new fort be established near the edge of the wood. Perhaps in time the new fort of Leafous Alo’ne may calm the fears of others and attract new settlers. And if not, the giant guard waits to squish any hostile incursions into Nephilim lands. Perhaps their bones will make good bread.

> **Colonization.** Garag-nar has spoken. A new fortress is to be built upon the slopes of the frosted peaks. The land is considered sacred to the followers of Goran, but the Daemon Dreadlord has decided that conquest and expansion are the best methods of appeasing the mountain god.

**Hostile attack.** An otherwise peaceful morning in the market squares of Lahm are abruptly interrupted by guttural screams. A host of monstrous Forked tongues lunge from the riverbank and aisle the unsuspecting Nephilim. With chants of “go back to air-frica” they slaughter many of the merchants, and some they drag back to Toi Saurus as sacrifices to Ankai. A few lucky survivors are able to flee to the safety of Uruk and relay the terrible news. The FTs have taken Lahm Market and appear to be staying…but for what further purpose?

> **Neighbor expands.** Blurag stands in his people's newly founded village. He still cannot believe he is chief of the Inganae, and the youngest in their history. The deaths of his father and brothers still weigh heavy upon him as he gazes out across the water… and his small fleet of war-canoes… and he thinks about the future of his people

**Fantastic landmark.** Scouts tell of a strange find far to the east, a 3-sided marble obelisk with no visible tool marks. What’s more, its location and side walls line up too perfectly. On the Northwest side faces the wild jungle, to the northeast the lush and tame woods, and to the south the bare and hostile desert. Where many lands blend slowly from one biome to the next, these 3 have crisp lines demarking them from each other. Perhaps the obelisk was built to commemorate this geographical oddity…or perhaps it caused it.

> **New Tribe.** One of the primary purposes of establishing Goran’s watch was the extraction of obsidian from the deep mines beneath the Frosted Twins… Oh the hubris. All of the parties sent to begin mining went missing immediately, with no word of their status. After sending a squad of Greater Daemon warriors into the mines, it was discovered that they are infested with viscous rat-things. Now not only have the mining efforts ceased, but few dare wander outside of Goran’s Watch after dark. Perhaps these diabolical creatures are the source of the god Goran’s wrath when destroying the town to the south? Who can say…

**New Tribe.** A band of Nephilim magi returning from a season of studying the strange tri sided obelisk return home to Uruk with news of a strange primitive tribe in the wild wooded region of Jungalia. Sentient ape like men wander the their tree villages and appear to speak a similar language to the Nephilim, similar enough at least for introductions, statements of peaceful intent, and perhaps some misinterpreted insults. They remain in their trees for now…or rather…our trees.

> **Colonization.** Garag-nar, the Daemon Dreadlord, studies the wall of The Dread Keep’s warchamber, and the map upon it. The daemon engineers just sent word back, the methane processing facility is operational. This new resource could be an entirely new source of energy, sending the daemon horde into a new age of industry…. Or it could be used as a tool of destruction. The setback at the obsidian mines (curse the damned rat-men) has slowed the armory’s build-up, and war is ever on the horizon. The Frosted Twins are a treasure trove of resources, but much blood will need to be shed to claim the invaluable obsidian within…

**Neighbors Expand**
The Simul Fortis are on the move. Scouts report a newly constructed stone fortress for the ape men, impressive given their backwards ways. Regrettably they appear to be preparing for some sort of attack. Fort Thumbs as our court jester has called it, lies less than a days march from our stolen market, albeit across the river (poor bastards with their open noses…if they want to cross they’ll need some boats) Perhaps they will aid us in our plight against the Forked tongues occupying our land…or perhaps we’ll be sporting new Ape fur coats come winter.

> **Neighbors Expand**
It's been long months since the priests of Gorgon came to Blurag to describe their recent visions. Visions depicting magic black stone beneath the great mountain. An expedition was ordered immediately, followed by a full scale invasion of the holy island. Gorgon wills it! Why else would he send such visions? Blurag now stands at the new fort, which will serve as a beachhead for the war to come. His scouts have taken a lay of the land, and found nothing but a ruined city, and a fortress that didn't even have scouts posted… The fools! This war for the stone will surely be a short one...

# Age of Empires

![thirdage](ThirdAge.png)

**Settlers Leave, new faction.** Disgruntled with the Viceroys seeming reluctance to drive the Forked tongues from their lands and reclaim the market and appalled by the idea of abiding sentient ape men to wander so close to real citizens has resulted in rather sizable band of fringe Nephilim leaving Uruk and founding their own farming settlement. Likely communists. Unwilling to lend any credibility to this split, the Viceroy himself only refers to them as the “Seperatists”. The court jester, ever the naming genius, has the commoners referring to the settlement as “Splitsville”. Separatists…we’ll see how long they remain so. 

> **Trade.** When the horde first began ravaging the Barrows, a group of daemons realized the value in gold and gems within the crypts. These daemons formed a coalition, and named themselves the Guild of Merchants. Over time, Garag-nar realized the potential value of this currency. The Guild agreed to buy surplus weapons, in exchange for some of their gold. These weapons were yet to be analyzed, and their worth completely unknown. Some were blessed with terrible enchantments, some simply very old swords, others totally useless junk. Recently, The Guild learned of the nation of the Nephilim. They might use greatswords as regular swords, longswords as daggers; who knows what they may trade for some of these ancient weapons? A trade ship has been loaded down and sent South to make-a-deal

**Thriving Village.** Kanoodear thrives with the new arrival of the devilish, but so far amenable, trade ships of daemon creatures. Traders tell us they call themselves the Barrows Ravagers. Flooding the small town with a surplus of weaponry, our Nephilim forces grow stronger, as does the expanded city of Kanoodear. The new race of devilmen seem rather keen on trading their so called greatswords (scholarship is still unsure why, as they appear appropriately sized for anything called a sword) for our surplus of redstone. Given that our magi tell us there is currently but 1 known mine producing redstone, the grand Vizier sees little risk in handing over what we can spare. As far as we know, only our wisemen have even begun to unlock its potential. Perhaps the Ravagers eat it? Or perhaps they too will find another use. Who can say.

> **Settlers Leave – New Faction.** The Methane processing plant of the Sunken Marsh is largely autonomous and self governing. The foreman of the facility has seen fit to take hobbit slaves from the nearby village, as their tiny hands are perfect for some machinery… Rumors have recently spread of a village of daemons deep within the nearby jungle…. A village with some very… hobbit-like daemons…. As long as the methane flows, nobody asks too many questions. That being said, these tiny daemons have no affiliation with the horde of the Barrows Ravagers

**Expand.** Times are good in the realm of the Nephilim. Scholarship thrives, craftsmen build, and the people…need more space. Some prefer the quiet countryside’s to the busy city life, and given all the new giant mouths to feed, more farms and food seem a prudent idea. Despite the ever looming threat of the hostile Forked Tongues, the grand Vizier has guaranteed the protection of the new farming town of Weizenheim. And should the croups fail, perhaps we can grind the bones of the cold-blooded menace. 

> **Rising Cult.** The Obsidian War has been dragging on for years upon Goran’s Isle. The daemon horde and the Inganae warriors skirmish during the day, but are both afraid to be caught in the field at night. The Skaven swarm around the mountain after dark, and their numbers are otherworldly. In a disturbing turn of events, a group of Daemon shaman has decided that the only way to end the stalemate is to kill Goran himself. They’ve established themselves in the ruins to the south, and are convinced that the key to the god’s destruction lies somewhere in the burned out city…

**Military expansion.** While the talking apes continue to live as peaceful neighbors, borderland skirmishes continue ever onward with the cold-blooded Forked Tongues. The common folk withing the walls of Uruk grow wrestles as long years pass while the Market is still occupied by hostile lizard folk so close to home. Unwilling to risk open war in the countryside, the grand Vizier decided instead that rather than attack the Market head on he will begin applying pressure abroad. Construction is begun and subsequently completed on the new military fortress simply known as the Complex. Strategicly placed close to the food and weapon imports from the nearby Nephilim town of Kanoodear, and also withing observation and, should the situation require, striking distance of the lizard capital city, the army sits ever watchful atop the booming towers of the Complex. Tensions continue to grow, and all remain alert. Surely the grand Vizier would not have commissioned this fortress were not his magi whispering words of war mongering in his ears… 

> **War.** After years of skirmishes upon Goran’s Isle, Garag-nar decided that something had to be done. The daemon horde was rallied in force and sent to the Obsidian mines, along with the faction’s entire supply of liquid methane, stored in hundreds upon hundreds of barrels. The daemon scientists had finally found a use for the strange red mineral traded from the big men to the south… when ground into a powder, it was quite flammable. Many of the barrels were coated with a residue of the powderized redstone. The daemon horde fought their way to the deep caverns, the skaven strategically falling back and waiting to surround the force once they descended. Instead, barrel after barrel was hurled down into the blackness. Garag-nar himself lit the torch that set the trail of redstone ablaze that lead to the first barrel in the chain reaction. The horde retreated while the fuze burned down… the series of explosions and toxic fumes that burned through the mines that day killed countless Skaven (along with any of the horde that didn’t make it out in time). The horde descended, long after the air cleared, and killed any who survived. After the assault, part of the horde remained to garrison the mine and build up its defenses; for the Inganae were now the primary threat on the island– Successful Assault 

**Disaster/famine.** Long have the residents of Bogsmead struggled to scrape a living out of the swamp. Times have oft been hard, causing the town to occasionally seek less than ideal means of food to feed their population. While grain supplies from the mainland help some, the grand Vizier ceased all commerce to or from the island and enacted a military blockade before anyone was sure what happened. Within days of the ships mooring in the harbor, but no sailors coming ashore, rampant disease broke out amongst the townsfolk. Rumors of bad reptile meat, or possibly poisonous swamp fumes, have been debated to be the cause, but what is certain is within the month the entire town was dead. Commoners in the capital debate furiously the ethics of leaving an entire town to perish, but all remain thankful that the blight was kept offshore lest it surely have brought the entire empire to its knees. Perhaps one day we will rebuild Bogsmead, for now it remains a crumbling reminder of the natural terrors of this world.

> **Trade.** The Guild of Merchants has had great success with their trade deals to the South. The redstone that they’ve stockpiled in trade is selling very well, and daemon spellcasters are certain there’s even more uses for the mineral that are yet to be discovered. In dealing with the Nephilim, The Guild has learned more about the lizardmen across the river… After much debate, it was decided to expand the Grand Market and to begin sending weapons and redstone to the lizardmen in secret. Surely they are desperate for weapons in their war, and if they are funding both sides The Guild is guaranteed to be on the winning side… The only concern of course being the potential wrath of the large men if they ever found out

**Trade.** With Bogsmead in ruin, the magi convince the Vizier that the time is now for expanding the Nephilims trade network. While Bogsmead may not have been a center of power for arts, culture, or much of anything, it did supply a steady income of food and peat to feed and warm the empire. Sailor stories tell a tribe of lion hunters far to the north and a trade ship is sent to broker a deal. It took some convincing that our merchants were not in fact there to eat them, but after they saw the value in steady trade between the races their leader agreed. The grand Vizier has issued an edict to the merchants guild however, no redstone shall be sent to the lion tribe. They are still a bit backward in their ways and we know little of their intentions. Imagine the chaos the that could unfold should they weaponize it and turn their sites towards us. The only thing left to do would be to grind their bones for bread.

> **War.** Believing the obsidian war to be all but over, the daemon commander Burgan-ran decided to lead a raid from the garrison of the obsidian mine. Gathering his forces, he left his stockpile of processed redstone dust behind (for he was planning on a quick raid, and scouting mission) and he set out to break through the Iganae toothpick-wall and set some fires in the night. As his forced approached the gates of the beach head fort, he realized something was amiss. There were GIANT iron bands across the new gates, with GIANT metal reinforcements across the wall. On top of said wall were an assortment of artillery, complete with scorpions with GIANT bowed wood and complex mechanisms… since when have the Inganae been capable of such GIANT works of craftsmanship?? His last thought as his force was bombarded to pieces was that surely these savages had some form of GIANT friends… - **Devastating loss and counter attack**
> 
> Blurag watches from the shadows up in the cliffs as the daemon force leaves the gates of the Obsidian Mines. His force of 2 dozen warriors sneak in through an old skaven tunnel, torches lit. Their mission; to steel the precious redstone and kill any daemons left guarding it. The priests of the Inganae are sure that it has some form of mystic properties… As Blurag leads his force through the tunnels, he reads strange runes on the walls, in a language he doesn’t know. Rounding a corner he sees an image of a skull and crossbones… an ominous warning. Rounding another corner he sees a faded painting. He draws close, moving his torch near to make out the painting… it depicts a large torch with an X marked through it. He looks around and notices barrels lining the walls. “PUT OUT YOUR-“
The detonation of the redstone stockpile kills the Inganae, and cracks the nearby supporting pillars, bringing tons of stone down. The obsidian wars are brought to an abrupt end with the destruction of the mine. A monument is put up in memory of Blurag – **Pyrrhic victory**

**Rising cult.** Wars and rumors of wars stir across the greater continents and lesser islands alike. With the recent plague decimating Bogsmead, the constant raids by Forked Tongues, the increasingly inquisitive (and frighteningly muscular) Simul Fortis, all at the doorstep of Nephilim kind, tensions rise daily. Pairing with the strange dealings of the devil men, hitherto friendly…. enough, and discoveries of yet ever more sentient beings across the world, many of the lesser learned (or simply down on their luck) Nephilim begin to turn to old sorcerous ways. 
 
Shortly after researchers brought the grand Vizier news of the Obelisks true make up, some strange colored version of OBSIDIAN, a large band of disgruntled giants flocked to the foot of the Obelisk. Chanting strange hymns to some lesser known pagan goddess by the name of either Narnia Novus, Nern Newson, or possibly Narnova, the cultish crowd soon turned violent. Killing all the remaining researchers, including a prominent Magi to the grand Vizier, they quickly built up a small fortress of logs and limestone. Who can say what goes on behind the heathenous walls at the Obelisk, but spies return with mixed tales of strange practices. If the spies reports are to be believed, this new cult, going by the name of Mov Petra, appears to believe that by harnessing the Obelisks power they may ignite a war kill all other gods and place their pagan goddess on the throne. While the grand Vizier was at first pleased to hear this (the Nephilim despise Ankai for casting them to this mortal realm), reports indicate that the Mov Petra believe that their goddess requires not only the gods, but all sentient life, to be obliterated before she will elevate her loyal followers and gift them the ashes of the world.
 
For now the guards keep watch, the spies learn what they can, and the grand Vizier bides his time. More must be learned before action can be taken. Perhaps the devil men know more of this pagan goddess. Perhaps they planted these mischievous apocalyptic thoughts in the hearts and minds of the lower classes. Perhaps some of them serve this goddess in secret. Perhaps they are the cause.

> **War.** When Garag-nar hears about the destruction of the Obsidian mines, he flies into a rage. His counter attack arrives together from both sea and land. The Inganae have clearly gone through a revolution in technology, sailing on GIANT war-canoes, with GIANT defenses. The battle is brutal, and the daemon force would have retreated on more than one occasion if not for the presence of the Dreadlord. By the end of the battle, the few surviving Inganae flee across the water, and the daemons fall back to Goran’s watch… Garag-nar brings only one momento back from the battle, a silver coin the size of a dinner tray, found in the lockbox of the fort. The dreadlord knows that his faction has funded the enemies of the giant-men, he knows that to ruin their trade deal with the Nephilim would be foolishness… but he also remembers. – **Pyrrhic victory**

# Rise and Fall

![fourthage](FourthAge.png)

**Disaster.** A disheveled corporal drags his bum leg down the courtyard at Uruk toward the grand Vizier. Smelling of smoke, covered in burn marks, and with no visible eyebrows, he recounts the misfortune of a routine training exercise gone awry. Unfortunately, a new recruit misread the layout instructions for cleaning the latrines at the Complex and thru a rather unfortunate chain of events inadvertently set off the stockpile of redstone being reserved for the coming assault on Toi Saurus. The Complex was reduced to rubble, the corporal to a rag doll, and the recruit to a brief pink mist. The grand vizier shakes his head at the lunacy and stupidity…and summarily has the corporal burned at the stake.

> **Hostile Attack.** Kerman Brindlebum awoke in his cell. It had been months since he’d been kidnapped by the monsters and forced to work in the methane factory. He realized what woke him up when the figure of a hobbit, dressed all in black with black face paint, separated itself from the shadows. “My name is Jebediah, I’m the commander of eele team 3, I’m here to take you home” he said. 
“oh wow” said Kerman. 
“…because we’re halflings” said Jebediah. 
“… right” said Kerman. 
“and 3 is half of 6”, Jebediah continued. 
“…. oh” said Kerman. Jebediah quickly opened the gate to the cell and lead Kerman out into the hallway. He saw the corpse of a daemon guard slumped against the wall, an arrow through his eye. They continued on through an emergency exit, stepping over a daemon engineer with his throat slit. Outside, they met the other hobbit slaves waiting for them. “Follow me, we have boats waiting” said Jebediah, and continued on. As he walked past a shrub, a voice from within squeaked “the chicken is in the pot”. Without breaking stride Jebediah muttered “then cook it”. Behind them, explosions tore the factory apart…

**Neighboring war.** The talking apes have slumbered in their trees long enough. Fort Thumbs is all a buzz with the grumbles and grunts of hairy figures. Spears glisten in the moon light and a vast army of Simul Fortis paddle across the river and strike the Forked Tongues at the occupied Market. Having long dismissed the apes as backwards savages, little more than animals themselves, the forked tongues had never taken the threat seriously. Of course, this weakness was exploited by our most illustrious grand Vizier, who supplied the unswimmable monkeys with watercraft to cross the river at night. Soon the Nephilim will strike the cold blooded menace as well, but why should we not soften them first by expending the friendly blood of our ape neighbors? Successful assault, and the apes now have a taste for lizard meat.

> **War.** The commander at Goran’s watch received a spy report, implicating the cult of Goran’s Doom with both the terrorist attack on the methane refinery, as well as giving the Inganae information on the redstone reserves and old skaven tunnels during the war. Surely this was all done in some bizarre attempt to kill the god Goran… and maybe it even succeeded. In the years since the war, Goran’s influence has waned across the land. In response, the commander gathered a force and marched on the ruins to the south, killing any and all cult members. Many shrines to an “Ankai the god-killer” (some lizard god?) were discovered during the assault. Surely these are dark days, as daemons slaughter daemons in the ruins of the once-great city. –Pyrrhic victory

**Diaspora – New Faction.** Grand Viziers have come, and grand viziers have gone. None were willing to do what was necessary to subdue the lizard menace. Or so the bastard breed from the once thriving Weiznheim say. In droves they left the town, leaving the new Grand Vizier in a peculiar position. Can we really just let peasants determine their own fate? It appears they feel they would be better off in the trees with the damn dirty apes. Rumors circle of a new settlement of ape and Nephilim together, a town called Ferngulia. Yes the apes have always been peaceable and cooperative with us, but to view them as equals, or even preferable to the grand city of Uruk…disgusting really. For now, the Magi urge the Vizier to leave well enough alone. In time the commoners will forget this mess. And so long as the Simul Fortis remain where they are, no more trouble should come of this. Still, perhaps it would be best to ready the troops…for defensive purposes of course

> **Hostile Attack.** A trade ship saw smoke rising from The Grand market East while approaching the docks. The traders discovered the merchants in the market were all slaughtered, and the weapons used were clearly ancient. Some daemons had charred wounds with burned out eyes, some were turned to stone, others were clearly beaten to death with old, blunt battleaxes. So far nobody has taken credit for the attack, was it the Giant men, angered by trade deals with the lizard men? Was it Inganae, seeking to steal the recent delivery of hobbit-slaves to the market? lizards, looking for a war? Maybe even a new faction hidden within the Barrows Ravagers? Perhaps time will tell

**WAR!** Long have the magi whispered in the ear of the grand viziers. Long have the people waited for justice against the lizard menace, only to told to wait a while longer. Children eaten, loved ones abused, and our tolerance has reached its end. In a heated moment of passion following the dismemberment of one of his very own royal children, the Vizier launches into a public speech and stirs the populace to decisive action. By dawn the next day the grand army is assembled at the gates of Uruk, clad in glistening plate body cuirass’s the size of Buicks, swords the length of spears, spears the length of trees, square shields the size of really big square shields, and various Redstone contraptions, they are ready to do the Viziers bloody biding. By noon they are aboard the grand navy transports and within hours reach the shores of Toi Saurus. In a fit of rage, the ships head straight for the beach, and legions of mad giants rush over board, charging the unsuspecting defenses. Shattering pike wall and lizard skulls alike in single fell swoops from their mighty axes and warhammers, the Nephilim set to task dismantling the lizard stone walls before their very eyes. One of the Nephilim captains spots the lizard king, rushes ahead of his men, and thrusts his clenched fist clear through the lizards heart. Upon the sight of their once proud lord now crushed underheel, the forked tongue capital turns into a full on route. Emboldened by the kingslaying, slaughter of the poor Nephilim royaly, and with generations of bloodfueds to settle, the grand army looses all manner of what little restraint they had and runs down the routing lizards from house to house, ripping them with giant bare hands, roasting them over open fires of burning lizard houses, and generally having a blast at the best bbq of all time. Surely news of this great triumph will spread far and wide and all shall know of the furry of the great Nephilim warriors. A fantastic blow has been dealt to the long-time lizard enemy as their king is dead and their once great capital rests securely in the hands of new Nephilim settlers. So great are the spoils and public morale from the victory that all wish to continue the war/genocide/bbq and finish off all remnants of the forked tongues. The new military fortress of Fort Sonny’s is constructed outside the last lizard strong hold at BiCastle. ***Great Victory.**

> **Evil Lurks.** It was discovered who attacked the market, and it was worse than feared. A cult of daemons, The Knights of Dagrond-mau, apparently have an affinity for the Nephilim (likely a shared hatred of Ankai) as well as a hatred of the Forked Tongues. The cult struck a blow to the Ankai-worshipping lizard men by ending trade, while also gathering a decent supply of weapons. Emboldened by the recent military success of the giants, The Knights made their presence known. They publicly broke from The Barrow Ravagers and established a fortress upon the ruins of the old market. Whats worse is that many of the Barrow Ravagers secretly support the cult, both because of its members’ service during the war, as well as the notion that the gods aren’t to be trusted. The guild of merchants hired a sizeable mercenary force to defend the remaining western market, hoping to prevent another slaughter. Garag-nar stayed his hand, hoping to prevent all out civil war, but the outlook did not look promising.
