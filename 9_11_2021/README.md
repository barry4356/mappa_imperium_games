# Age of Discovery

![secondage](SecondAge.png)

**Colonization.** The Nephalim take to the seas in their giant canoes! Paddling for what couldn’t have been more than 5 minutes, they hastily arrive on the shores of Lake Loch Island; a new land awaits! Eager settlers flock to the new village and before long the bustling coastal town of Kanoodear was born. But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? Tis the lizardfolk across the water, surely this expansion will be consequence free...

**Ancient Ruins.** Scouts return to the Dread Keep, with news of the surrounding world. It has been known that Narnova (goddess of the hearth) is a dominant force upon these lands, but signs indicate a second god, Goran. 
Nearby, to the East, lies the frosted isle. Scouts report spotting the ruins of a once great city upon the island. No worldly power could have wrought such destruction, and few know the wrath of an angry god better than the Barrow Ravagers. Perhaps another temple is required...

**Fantastic landmark!** Long have there been tales of strange disappearances in the deep wood. What was once thought to be no more than old wives tales begins to prove true with the news of a decimated hunting party. Returning with less than half their original members, the survivors are visibly shaken. They bring word of a deeper wood in the heart of the forest. A strange grove of impossibly old trees with runes carved in the bark. But how could there be footprints leading out of the mystic grove when there were no prints leading in...has Anki cast out another?

**New Geography.** Garag-nar stares out across the Barrows from the battlements of The Dread Keep, and ponders the scout report he just received. A party of lesser-daemons returned from the frosted isle, with a more detailed mapping of the isle’s geography, including a new river. However, it’s the very end of their report that has Garag-nar now pondering; the mast of a ship spotted to the East. Within Garag-nar, his patience and his blood-lust feud. From the seemingly endless crypts beneath the Barrows, they’ve found an abundance of both man-flesh and ancient weapons (thank the foolish mortals for burying their dead with their valuables). The armories of The Dread Keep grow more full by the day. Garag-nar stares East, and Garag-nar ponders...

**Colonization.** Taking to the high seas once more, the intrepid Nephilim explorers find yet another new land. Full of mostly giant bugs and giant swamps, the Island of Fools Quagmire proved to be a giant pain for the giant fools. With no desire to stay, the explorers promptly packed their backs to paddle home when they realized they had gotten themselves thoroughly lost in the swamp. While they did eventually find a reliable route back to the high seas, they had already given up hope and founded the new bustling, and buzzing with mosquitos, town of Bogsmead.

**New tribe.** A small fishing boat washed up on the shores of the wastes. After briefly interrogating (and subsequently devouring) the boat’s tiny, squealing occupant, it was discovered that he did not speak any known language. It was assumed that he originated from the isle of sunken marshland. Scouts should be sent to investigate further

**Expansion.** In the wake of a recent uptick in disappeared villagers, the lords in the council of Uruk declare that a new fort be established near the edge of the wood. Perhaps in time the new fort of Leafous Alo’ne may calm the fears of others and attract new settlers. And if not, the giant guard waits to squish any hostile incursions into Nephilim lands. Perhaps their bones will make good bread.

**Colonization.** Garag-nar has spoken. A new fortress is to be built upon the slopes of the frosted peaks. The land is considered sacred to the followers of Goran, but the Daemon Dreadlord has decided that conquest and expansion are the best methods of appeasing the mountain god.

**Hostile attack.** An otherwise peaceful morning in the market squares of Lahm are abruptly interrupted by guttural screams. A host of monstrous Forked tongues lunge from the riverbank and aisle the unsuspecting Nephilim. With chants of “go back to air-frica” they slaughter many of the merchants, and some they drag back to Toi Saurus as sacrifices to Ankai. A few lucky survivors are able to flee to the safety of Uruk and relay the terrible news. The FTs have taken Lahm Market and appear to be staying…but for what further purpose?

**Neighbor expands.** Blurag stands in his people's newly founded village. He still cannot believe he is chief of the Inganae, and the youngest in their history. The deaths of his father and brothers still weigh heavy upon him as he gazes out across the water… and his small fleet of war-canoes… and he thinks about the future of his people

**Fantastic landmark.** Scouts tell of a strange find far to the east, a 3-sided marble obelisk with no visible tool marks. What’s more, its location and side walls line up too perfectly. On the Northwest side faces the wild jungle, to the northeast the lush and tame woods, and to the south the bare and hostile desert. Where many lands blend slowly from one biome to the next, these 3 have crisp lines demarking them from each other. Perhaps the obelisk was built to commemorate this geographical oddity…or perhaps it caused it.

**New Tribe.** One of the primary purposes of establishing Goran’s watch was the extraction of obsidian from the deep mines beneath the Frosted Twins… Oh the hubris. All of the parties sent to begin mining went missing immediately, with no word of their status. After sending a squad of Greater Daemon warriors into the mines, it was discovered that they are infested with viscous rat-things. Now not only have the mining efforts ceased, but few dare wander outside of Goran’s Watch after dark. Perhaps these diabolical creatures are the source of the god Goran’s wrath when destroying the town to the south? Who can say…

**New Tribe.** A band of Nephilim magi returning from a season of studying the strange tri sided obelisk return home to Uruk with news of a strange primitive tribe in the wild wooded region of Jungalia. Sentient ape like men wander the their tree villages and appear to speak a similar language to the Nephilim, similar enough at least for introductions, statements of peaceful intent, and perhaps some misinterpreted insults. They remain in their trees for now…or rather…our trees.

**Colonization.** Garag-nar, the Daemon Dreadlord, studies the wall of The Dread Keep’s warchamber, and the map upon it. The daemon engineers just sent word back, the methane processing facility is operational. This new resource could be an entirely new source of energy, sending the daemon horde into a new age of industry…. Or it could be used as a tool of destruction. The setback at the obsidian mines (curse the damned rat-men) has slowed the armory’s build-up, and war is ever on the horizon. The Frosted Twins are a treasure trove of resources, but much blood will need to be shed to claim the invaluable obsidian within…

**Neighbors Expand**
The Simul Fortis are on the move. Scouts report a newly constructed stone fortress for the ape men, impressive given their backwards ways. Regrettably they appear to be preparing for some sort of attack. Fort Thumbs as our court jester has called it, lies less than a days march from our stolen market, albeit across the river (poor bastards with their open noses…if they want to cross they’ll need some boats) Perhaps they will aid us in our plight against the Forked tongues occupying our land…or perhaps we’ll be sporting new Ape fur coats come winter.

**Neighbors Expand**
It's been long months since the priests of Gorgon came to Blurag to describe their recent visions. Visions depicting magic black stone beneath the great mountain. An expedition was ordered immediately, followed by a full scale invasion of the holy island. Gorgon wills it! Why else would he send such visions? Blurag now stands at the new fort, which will serve as a beachhead for the war to come. His scouts have taken a lay of the land, and found nothing but a ruined city, and a fortress that didn't even have scouts posted… The fools! This war for the stone will surely be a short one...
